        "During a summer internship funded by an EPSRC Vacation Bursary at the University of Leeds’ Institute of Functional Surfaces, I worked on a research project investigating a novel inductive sensing technique to detect wear in non-conductive materials used in joint replacements. The project aimed to explore early-stage feasibility and inform future experimental development.",

        "I began by conducting a review of academic literature covering wear mechanisms and existing sensing techniques in total joint replacements, with a focus on non-conductive materials like UHMWPE. This background research provided context for the novel inductive approach and helped guide test design. I also summarised relevant findings to support protocol planning for lab work, ensuring the project was grounded in current scientific understanding.",

        "In collaboration with PhD students, I helped develop and test a sensor calibration procedure to establish baseline inductance readings. I analysed experimental data from previous tests in Excel, identifying trends and inconsistencies across batches of sensors. This work informed adjustments to calibration protocols and helped ensure measurement reliability before more complex testing.",

        "I assembled a working electrical circuit using inductive sensor PCBs, a breadboard, NI MyRIO controller, and LabVIEW software to visualise live sensor readings. I designed and ran simple proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate that sensor inductance reliably decreased when a metal target embedded within a polymer material was exposed—validating the basic principle of the sensing method.",

        "To simulate wear in a controlled setting, I designed and 3D printed custom PEEK fixtures for mounting the sensors onto a UMT tribometer. I set up and conducted sliding wear tests and used Excel to analyse the output. Some tests showed a consistent drop in inductance over time, indicating successful detection of material removal, although results also highlighted sensitivity to noise and the need for further refinement."

        "This project, developed during my role at Lucid as part of an Innovate UK-funded initiative, aimed to create a novel force measurement platform tailored for elite athletic performance analysis. I contributed across four key areas: testing, data analysis, applied research, and technical support — working closely with stakeholders and end users to ensure the system was effective, accurate, and practical for real-world use.",

        "In the testing phase, I led early-stage evaluations of prototype devices to improve usability and establish consistent procedures for capturing reliable data. A major focus was determining optimal body positions and configurations during testing. Recognising setup as a key factor in data repeatability, I developed a setup algorithm based on anthropometric ratios and CAD modelling to standardise the configuration process for users of varying heights.",

        "I developed a secure web application using Flask, SQLite and Chart.js to present data from testing to project stakeholders, potential end users and Innovate UK assessors. This application allowed for interactive data visualisation, enhancing user experience and facilitating informed decision-making. The app also included user authentication to ensure data security and privacy.",

        "My research efforts focused on investigating the biomechanics of running. I used wearable IMUs and high-speed video to capture running gait and kinematics at varying speeds. This work helped relate device outputs to real-world performance parameters, informing both setup recommendations and future academic studies. These findings were instrumental in bridging lab-based data with real-use athletic scenarios.",

        "Drawing on my detailed understanding of the device, I provided technical support for its use in external research, including studies by the University of Salford and Leicester City Football Club. I led live demonstrations and assisted academic users with both hardware and software. The University of Salford’s MRes study, which I supported, found strong correlations between device output and both gold-standard lab equipment and sprint performance metrics, validating the system's accuracy and practical value."

        "As part of a multidisciplinary team at Lucid, I worked on the in-house development of a pressure sensing system used in anorectal manometry and biofeedback procedures. This ISO 13485-compliant medical device includes a pressure-sensing probe, charging dock, and calibration unit, and has been deployed to medical centres across the UK. My responsibilities covered design, manufacturing, documentation, and testing of the system throughout its development lifecycle.",

        "I implemented design changes to key system components using SOLIDWORKS, incorporating feedback from clinicians and end users. I designed and fabricated tooling for both vacuum casting (polyurethane and silicone parts) and vacuum forming (ABS components), enabling repeatable, high-quality production of housing and functional elements. These design changes improved usability and manufacturability, playing a vital role in preparing the system for clinical use.",

        "To fulfil a commercial purchase order, I led the hands-on manufacture of 20 patient-ready systems. This included the complete assembly of pressure probes, calibration units, and docking stations using techniques such as 3D printing, laser cutting, vacuum casting, and soldering. I also performed both mechanical and electronic assembly, ensuring all units met stringent functional and safety standards before deployment.",

        "Maintaining high-quality documentation was a key part of my role. I updated and organised BOMs, production records, technical drawings, and design verification and validation reports to meet ISO 13485 standards. I also worked with project leads to streamline document management processes, ensuring audit readiness. This documentation has consistently met the rigorous standards of our annual ISO 13485 audits without issue.",

        "I conducted a range of standardised tests on the system as part of design verification and validation. These included accelerated aging studies, material compatibility assessments, and risk-based software testing aligned with ISO 14971. The testing results provided evidence of the system’s reliability, supporting its safe and effective use in clinical settings and informing further development decisions."

        "This project, carried out in my current role at Lucid, focused on developing a next-generation reciprocating saw and vacuum system for plaster cast removal. Working with a commercial client, my contributions spanned mechanical analysis, motor selection, and structural evaluation of key components — supporting the design team in making informed, data-driven decisions across the product development cycle.",

        "To analyse the saw’s core mechanical system, I developed a Python-based mathematical model of the eccentric cam mechanism. This allowed for theoretical calculation of displacement, velocity, and acceleration profiles at various operating speeds. These outputs helped inform design parameters such as eccentricity and shaft offset, guiding decisions to ensure sufficient range of blade motion while minimising stress on critical components. The model also supported analysis of counterbalancing strategies to reduce reactive forces on the motor shaft and housing.",

        "For motor selection, I assessed multiple DC motor options by extracting torque-speed data from technical datasheets and plotting operational curves. I calculated the expected current draw under load and cross-referenced it with the motor’s thermal limits to avoid overheating. This analysis ensured that the final motor choice would reliably meet the torque and speed requirements of the saw during prolonged operation without risk of failure.",

        "I conducted finite element analysis (FEA) on polypropylene components designed to secure the vacuum tube during storage. The goal was to determine the required insertion/removal force and confirm that stresses remained within the material’s elastic range. By following FEA best practices for polymer analysis, I provided confidence in the robustness of the design and supported the decision to proceed with tooling for mass production, helping accelerate the project timeline.",

        "Overall, my work contributed to critical design decisions that improved the mechanical performance and manufacturability of the product. The combination of system-level modelling and detailed component analysis enabled the team to move forward with confidence in both function and feasibility, ensuring the product met operational requirements and was ready for scaled manufacturing."
