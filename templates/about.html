        <p class="mt-4">
            I’m a multidisciplinary engineer with a First-Class MEng in Aeronautical & Aerospace Engineering from the University of Leeds and several years of hands-on experience in product development, mechanical design, and technical problem-solving. With my background in mechanical engineering and my proficiency in several programming languages, I am able to bridge the gap between the physical and digital domains. Through my career to date I have contributed to the development of several innovative electro-mechanical systems in the medical and sports performance industries.        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Currently, I work as a Design Engineer at Lucid Innovation, where I’ve contributed to developing a range of novel medical and life science technologies involving advanced manufacturing, embedded systems, and user-centred design. I’ve led the development of functional prototypes, designed software features that improve user experience and performed pre-compliance testing according to several international medical device standards - all while collaborating with industrial designers, developers, and stakeholders to bring high-quality products to life.        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            At university, I led aerodynamic optimisation for a novel wing concept in an industry-sponsored research project. I was also awarded an EPSRC-funded research internship to investigate wear of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) components in total joint replacements using a novel sensing method.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            My experience and technical skills allow me to contribute to product development across all stages of the design process - from validating designs through computational modelling and systems analysis to issuing final product specifications. I bring a clear, communicative, and detail-oriented mindset which allows me to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams and with non-technical project stakeholders. I am passionate about developing emerging technologies, especially those that could have a positive impact on people’s lives, health or on the environment.         </p>

            Within this portfolio, you will find a series of projects I have worked on, with images and text explaining my role in them. I challenged myself to develop the website from scratch, using Flask, HTMX, Alpine-js and Tailwind CSS to create a sleek, responsive hypermedia-driven application. I plan to use this portfolio to track my professional development as my career as an engineer continues. Thanks for taking the time to view my portfolio.
